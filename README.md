# Safari-extensions-backup

Collection of frequently used extensions of Safari on macOS.

## Background

One day in Sep 2019, the specific date cannot be remembered, my safari on mac cannot download extensions via webpage, it was forced to jump to AppStore.app, and I found my wanted extension not in there, so I planed to collect them here, and they can be successfully installed manually.

## Extensions collection

* Then, you modify the filename extension from `.safariextz` to `.zip` or `.xar`.

* Then, choose the directory of your extension, and you will see the extension page in the current `Extension Builder` window, and click `run` button in the right top corner of the window. Now you can see the extension icon on your safari menu table and you can use your extension after restart your Safari.app sometimes. Enjoy it!
