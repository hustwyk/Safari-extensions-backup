# Safari-extensions-backup

Collection of frequently used extensions of Safari on macOS.

## Background

One day in Sep 2019, the specific date cannot be remembered, my safari on mac cannot download extensions via webpage, it was forced to jump to AppStore.app, and I found my wanted extension not in there, so I planed to collect them here, and they can be successfully installed manually.

## Extensions collection
